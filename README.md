# WACCM-Analysis
Analysis of the WACCM[^1] Model of particle precipitation in the ionosphere.

## Goals of the project
- Plot measured electron density profiles together with approximately simultaneous model electron density profiles.
- Describe differences in active and quiet ionospheric conditions.
- Find relation with different values (DST index[^2], hp30 Index[^3], IMF[^4], Wind Speed, SML[^5], SMU[^6], SME[^7], Densities value, Densities gradient and Height have been tested) (Latitude of the instrument might be possible)

## Informations
### Global informations
1) Experiments data
   - Mostly EISCAT[^8] measurements.
   - _May be possible to use data from other organisation_.
   - Sporadic measurements with variable height and time resolution.
   - Data is downloaded through the EISCAT website.
2) WACCM data
   - Data exist for more than 30 years and saved into ~250 MB files.
   - 3 Differents runs
     - NOSPE: Without energetic electrons or protons.
     - SPE: With energetic solar protons only.
     - EEPSPE: With both energetic protons and electrons.
   - Mixing ratio as a function of pressure levels as input.
   - No height resolution and half an hour time resolution.
3) Starting point
   - Years 2004, 2008 and 2011 have Geomagnetic Storms[^9] and Solar Proton[^10] events (See [here](Event-Informations.md)).
   - Convert both datasets into comparable format (i.e. height and time grid with fixed bins)
4) Code explanation and Analysis
   - Code explanation [here](Scripts/Description.md)
   - Analysis [here](Output/Analysis.md)
5) Known improvements
   - Currently,
      - a day is considered a geomagnetic or a solar proton event even if only 1 hour is the actual event.
      - an EISCAT measurements is accounted into a bin only if its starting height is within the bin.
   - Only 15 out of 338 events are active events, we need more data on other year to get more precise comparison with indices.
   - If the output `csv` file becomes too large, it is possible to remove all zeros rows but this would mean to change all analysis after.
