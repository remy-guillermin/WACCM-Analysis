# WACCM-Analysis
Analysis of the WACCM[^1] Model of particle precipitation in the ionosphere.

## Goals of the project
- Plot measured electron density profiles together with approximately simultaneous model electron density profiles.
- Describe differences in active and quiet ionospheric conditions.
- Find relation with differents value (DST index[^2], hp30 Index[^3], IMF[^4], Wind Speed, SML[^5], SMU[^6] and Height have been tested) (Latitude of the instrument might be possible)
  

## Informations
### Global informations
1) Experiments data
   - Mostly EISCAT[^7] measurements.
   - _May be possible to use data from other organisation_.
2) WACCM data
   - Data exist from 2000 to 2014.
   - 3 Differents runs
     - NOSPE: Without energetic electrons or protons.
     - SPE: With energetic solar protons only.
     - EEPSPE: With both energetic protons and electrons.   
3) Starting point
   - Years 2004, 2008 and 2011 have Geomagnetic Storms[^8] and Solar Proton[^9] events (See [here](Event-Informations.md)).
